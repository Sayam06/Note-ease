# Note-ease

A simple, minimal and beautiful notes app.

Note-ease is a simple and minimal note taking app. It gives you a quick and simple notepad editing experience when you take down memos, notes, messages, shopping and daily chores lists, etc. Taking notes with Note-ease is easier than any other notepad application. Most of the note-taking apps out there have a confusing interface, where the users aren't able to understand the working of the app due to the so called "advanced" features. Note-ease has been made for the sole purpose of taking text notes. 

Talking about security and privacy, all the data is stored locally, that is, your personal data is not sent to any sort of online database, it is stored on your device. Thus, the risk of unauthorized people getting access to your notes is almost negligible. Note-ease respects your privacy.

The app is free to use as well as advertisement-free, so that the users can have the best in-app experience out there.
