String ABOUTAPP =

If you weren't able to guess it correctly, here's the big secret: the name "Note-ease" has been derived from Cadbury's Nutties :)

Note-ease is a simple, minimal and beautiful note-taking app. Most of the note-taking apps out there have a confusing interface, where the users aren't able to
understand the working of the app due to the so called "advanced" features. Note-ease has been made for the sole purpose of taking text notes.

Talking about security and privacy, all the data is stored locally, that is, your personal data is not sent to any sort of online database, it is stored on your device. 
Thus, the risk of unauthorized people getting access to your notes is almost negligible. Note-ease respects your privacy.

The app is free to use as well as advertisement-free, so that the users can have the best in-app experience out there.

"Note-ease" is an open source application. The source code is available on GitHub. Check "About Developer" section to create a fork / pull request on GitHub!
