'''Roses are red, violets are blue, this app has been made, just for you :)

The '+' icon on the bottom right corner of the screen will allow you to add a new note.

To view a note, just tap on the coloured thumbnail. This will take you to "View Note" screen (yes, you are currently on the "View Note" screen).

You can edit or delete the note from this "View Note" screen.

To delete a note, tap on the red button you see on the bottom left.

To edit a note, tap on the yellow button on the bottom right.

Thats enough learning for now. You are now absolutely ready to add you first note-easily!
